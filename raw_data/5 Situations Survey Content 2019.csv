According to your supervisor one of you has to take a different week of vacation because it would be too busy at work if both of you are absent. Your colleague is not willing to change their vacation plans. What would you do and why?,"You have a project due in two weeks. Your workload is light leading up to the due date. You have confidence in your ability to handle the project, but are aware sometimes your boss gives you last minute tasks that can take significant amounts of time and attention. How would you handle this project and why?",You and a colleague have had a long day at work and you just find out you have been invited to a networking meeting with one of your largest clients. Your colleague is leaning towards not going and if they don't go you won’t know anyone there. What would you do and why?,"Your manager just gave you some negative feedback at work. You don’t agree with the feedback and don’t believe that it is true. Yet the feedback could carry real consequences (e.g., losing your annual bonus). How do you feel about this situation? What would you do?",The company closed a deal with a client from Norway and asks who would like to volunteer to be involved on the project. That person would have to learn some things about the country and culture but doesn't necessarily need to travel. Would you find this experience enjoyable or boring? Why?,"Here are a number of characteristics that may or may not apply to you.

If they aren't able to reschedule their plans I would look at my own plans to see if there was any room for rescheduling so I could take my vacation a week before or a week after. If that is possible I would go ahead and rearrange my plans to accommodate my coworker's vacation time. If it is not possible then I would accept the fact that I would not be able to take my vacation that week since it is very understandable that we would not be able to take the same week off.,I would work on my project as usual but I would be sure to not dawdle and prioritize my time when completing the project. I would put it first and check to see if any other tasks I have going on could wait until after the project is finished. This would ensure that the project is finished before the due date just in case my boss chose to delegate any other tasks to me last minute. If my boss did give me a task before the project was finished I would remind him or her that I am still working on the project and I would like to finish it first before I took on any more tasks that needed my immediate attention.,I would do what I could to get my coworker to understand how important this meeting is to the both of us and remind him or her of what good could come from us attending. If my coworker is still adamant about not going to the meeting I would just go alone. I would probably be uncomfortable but not knowing anyone there isn't reason enough for me to not go. Attending could possibly open up lots of opportunities for me so I would definitely not miss the chance to attend.,I would be annoyed with the feedback but I would just accept it and move on. I would look deeper into the feedback and see if there was some truth to it and maybe I am just not seeing it from my point of view. I would possibly even ask to set up a meeting with my manager to see if he or she could give me some help with the problems that were brought up and let it be known that I am trying to do my best. After that I would put that advice to work and do what I could to improve in the areas I received feedback in.,"I would find the experience very enjoyable. Learning about new places and cultures is always exciting and having this knowledge could put me ahead of others in my company and give me opportunities that others are not qualified for. Also, if the need to travel to Norway does arise I would be ready for the task and I would not be forced to learn all of that last minute and I would be well prepared.

I will also use this later on when I need to take a day and this happens again. I can also use this to my advantage with the colleague as well saying i decided to switch my day off so you could have your vacation still go through with no issue.  This is not ideal but it certainly allows me to show that I am not only a team player but a company person caring more about the companies needs than my own even if that is not the case.  Besides while that person is away its a perfect opportunity to work harder to make me even more valuable. ,I would take it on with zero complaints. I would keep in mind that at a certain point I should expect that my silly boss will add things to that at the last minute. Knowing this and still accepting the job I am focused to not only expect it but to thrive and make myself an even more successful employee. ,I would go with zero reservations or issues. If my silly colleague does not see the gravity of this opportunity oh well. To me this is not only a great opportunity to shine a brighter light on my company and it's benefits but also to make my name more known with the largest client we know. This always leads to them talking about you to your boss. In this case this is a slam dunk and I would secretly thank my colleague for running scared from such an opportunity. ,I would make it a point to say my peace to him and everyone else in the organization. If this goes without being fixed that means my value at this company is not high and that will be known as well. I will immediately begin working harder and smarter meaning no more help to colleagues and now everyone will know what I did and how much effort was put in it. I will also make it a point to be in another company within 3 months. ,I would find this extremly enjoyable how can one not?  How often am I going to steep myself into another culture and get paid for it. This reeps an enormous amount of knowledge and benefit for me. Not only am I increasing my personal growth but my personal abilities for future employers. Who knows maybe there will be a short time job in Norway. ,Agree a little,Neutral; no opinion,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree a little,Agree a little,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Agree strongly,Agree strongly,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree a little,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree a little,Neutral; no opinion,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree a little,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree a little,Agree strongly,Agree a little,Agree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree a little,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Agree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Agree strongly,Agree a little,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Disagree strongly,Agree strongly,Male,United States,,White,,21-29,Graduated from college (B.A./B.S.),A1M9DKI1CPKKTC,rJqOOSIN8p

One proviso here is that if the feedback is not based on work but on organizational problems or behavioral rumors, it's best to work through step by step and explain to help the manager come to a different conclusion.","I would love it!

Consider the deadline as make or break situation that could end your career.  Take it as an opportunity and let go of the threatening aspect of the situation. When you do this, you put your skills to win the challenge.  Before starting the work itself, if you’re worried about the situation then you won’t put your best to the work. This negative thought drains out your energy and makes the task more challenging and difficult.","  Be grateful: You are alone in the meeting, if you seek some query or help from others, don’t forget to say the magical works ‘Thank you’. By this you open the window to seek help again next time.  Be polite, calm and composed.. Don’t be too assertive or too defensive.. When you go to someone to talk, courteous enough to ask whether they are free and can spare few minutes. Don’t jump into every conversation without invitation. Be open to help ","I take all feedback seriously, as it either directly addressees gaps/issues with my performance OR informs me what information gaps / misperceptions people may have about my performance. So, I do think it pays to listen fully.    If I disagree with the feedback, I don’t think it pays to be combative or defensive. I would look at it as an opportunity to clarity what the other person doesn’t know. So, for example, if someone told me they think I need to do a better job of communicating to Team ABC about a project — and I think I have done that well — I may reply something like, “would you mind if I walked you through my communications to that team to date, and you can help me identify what may have been unclear?”    So, turn it into a win-win. Either you clarify in that discussion that you did communicate well. OR, you get some more productive feedback that you originally received on how to tweak your work to be more effective.",Helping others has great benefits of helping the giver. It reinforces information needed to improve ones own life. It's satisfying feeling being part of the solution rather then the problem. Helps with self esteem. Opens doors to new possibilities that may not have presented itself otherwise. It's the moral and right thing to do. Sharing gifts you possess is part of why they are there in the first place.

I would listen carefully and take notes.

I would try to plan out steps to complete the project and use the extra time since my workload is light. That way if I am approached by my boss and asked to do something, I would have the project complete or only have some very minor changes to make that could be done easily in the allotted time. ","I would do my best to try to convince him or her to go by focusing on the potential opportunities and positive outcomes that could occur. I would try to tell them that not showing up could make a bad impression and show disinterest in out clients. I would also ask what the alternatives are and what reasons he has for not going. I would feel uncomfortable alone as well and I would do my best to try to convince him or her. If that doesn't work, then I would try to provide some incentive or offer him or her a favor in return because of how much this meeting means for me, for us, and for our future. ","I would approach my manager in private to try to discuss the feedback. I would ask him to explain his stance again and the grounds he has to make such an assumption. After his arguments, I would present my own arguments explaining what I have done for the company, my strengths and how I have gone the extra mile to meet the needs of our business. I would ask him to kindly reconsider the feedback and tell him that if it is not apparent I will be sure to step up and make a difference if he changes the feedback he has left. I would also ask other colleagues to back me up if I feel comfortable enough with my manager so we could have an outside, third person's perspective that is not as biased. ","I would find it to be a very enjoyable experience. I love traveling and learning about other countries and cultures all over the world. Any way to expand my cultural knowledge is great, especially if it is for my business and would perhaps allow me to move up in the company after some time. I think that this would show the client genuine interest, help prevent miscommunications and form a close bond that will help the client and myself feel more comfortable. The client would also most likely know about the US and our culture so I think it is only fair we meet half way and show interest.
