A cleaned version of the raw data was provided to contestants in the 2019 SIOP machine learning competition. However, because the task was to generate predictions of aggregated scores using NLP algorithms, only aggregated data was provided. The purpose of this repository is to clean the full dataset to provide researchers with item-level and demographic data.
